# My-LOTR-Photo-App
Welcome to my first ever coding project: a Lord of the Rings Photo Web App. 

It's my version of the first project featured in the learning path for the [Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) by freeCodeCamp.

This project is very simple as its purpose is to learn the basics of HTML and coding. 

FreeCodeCamp has you create a cat photo appliation but, I wanted to create something that represented me and to make learning code fun.
